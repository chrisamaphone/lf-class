# Lecture 2: LF Type Theory


[Code](https://github.com/chrisamaphone/lf-class/blob/main/code/nat-even2.elf)

## Lecture plan

* LF type theory (minus lambda)
* Datatype encodings and (informal) adequacy

## Exercises
* Come up with a second proof that `(node (node leaf leaf) (node leaf leaf))`
  is balanced.
* Come up with both an extrinsic and intrinsic encoding for AVL trees. Show
  that the extrinsic encoding is not adequate, and that the intrinsic one
  is.
* Exercise (bonus): can you describe a type theory that "stratifies" the
  levels of [syntax, judgments, theorems], all of which LF uses dependent
  functions to represent? What would the advantages/disadvantages be?
