# Syllabus for CM 500: Logical Frameworks
## An uncourse by [Chris Martens](https://khoury.northeastern.edu/~cmartens)

### Course description
Logical frameworks are the formal systems that underlie proof assistants,
such as Twelf, Agda, Coq, Lean, etc. Due to instructor bias, we will focus
on the Edinburgh logical framework (LF), a tiny dependently typed calculus.
Students will learn how to use Twelf, a proof assistant based on logic
programming with LF, as well as the formal definition of LF and some of its
metatheory. With time/interest, we may examine Agda or Idris to compare
approaches.


### Prerequisites
Know how to read and write inference rules for type systems. Know what the
simply-typed lambda calculus is, and probably have seen a proof about it
before (e.g. normalization).


### When
* January 30 (first class) - February 29 (last class)
* Tuesdays and Thursdays
* 10:30am - Noon (Eastern US time zone)

### Where
Zoom only. See Zulip or reach out to instructor for link.

### Class format
Each week consists of two days of classes.
* DAY 1 will be dedicated to some kind of lecture and/or livecoding that participants are invited to follow along with.
* At the end of DAY 1, an exercise or two will be assigned, which participants should try to complete before DAY 2.
* DAY 2 will be dedicated to revisiting the exercises and discussing them. Participants are invited to show their solutions. Possibly more lecture and demonstration will follow, but in a less rigid/more improvised manner.

### Resources

* [The Twelf Wiki](http://twelf.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* Frank Pfenningâ€™s draft book on [Computation and
  Deduction](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/courses/comp523-08/cd.pdf)
