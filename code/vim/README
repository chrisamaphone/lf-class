This directory contains scripts for the Vim editor to aid in working with
Twelf.  Right now the scripts only really support syntax hilighting, but
there will also be support for compiling/debugging/editing in the future.

To install these scripts.  
  1.  Create a directory ~/.vim if you do not already have one.
  2.  Copy filetype.vim to ~/.vim, or append if you already have one.
  3.  Create a directory ~/.vim/syntax if you do not already have one.
  4.  Copy syntax/twelf.vim to ~/.vim/syntax.  

Make sure you have ":syntax enable" in your .vimrc file.
